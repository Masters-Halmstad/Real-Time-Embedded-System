Question: Consider the computeSomething function, which has a fixed-length execution time 
    slightly equal to 1 tick. Remove the code while(t==ticks);, compile the code, and boot 
    the RPi using the newly created kernel.
• What is the result and implication of removing the code while(t==ticks);? Elaborate on your
 answer.

>> The line while(t==ticks); is a synchronization point that replicates a very small but important
    delay ensuring that each task waits until the next system tick i.e., generated by the 
    interrupt before completing its current actibvation. 

>> When this line is removed, all tasks complete their work immediately without waiting for
    the next timer interrupt. As a result, all tasks run once almost simultaneously at 
    startup (printing 0 on all segments at once) lossing the synchronization which is 
    the main implication and then remain idle until their next activation time based on 
    their periods. After that, each task updates its display only when its relative 
    period (3, 5, or 7 ticks) expires.
>> Lossing the synchronization can break the task consistency and may result into race condition.
   For instance if there are several tasks rely on ticks, will run simultaneously providing 
    unexpected output. This can be dangerous for time sensitive applications
